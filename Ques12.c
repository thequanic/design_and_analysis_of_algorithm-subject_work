/*
Given an unsorted array of integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to
find Kth smallest or largest element in the array. (Worst case Time Complexity = O(n))
Input Format:
The first line contains number of test cases, T.
For each test case, there will be three input lines.
First line contains n (the size of array).
Second line contains space-separated integers describing array.
Third line contains K.
Output Format:
The output will have T number of lines.
For each test case, output will be the Kth smallest or largest array element.
If no Kth element is present, output should be “not present”.
